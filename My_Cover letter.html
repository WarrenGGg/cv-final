<h1><em>Warren Bradley Swarts Cover Letter.</em></h1>
<p><h4> Dear Sir/ Madam </h4>
 <h4><p>I am currently working as a Junior ICT Support Technician at the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth.
        I have previously held three positions at the Nelson Mandela University.
       The first was as a Supplemental Instructor in the Ebeit Department for Software development (C#) which the following year I got promoted to as a Supplemental Instructor Coordinator and the third was as a Student Lab Assistant(Intern) in the ICT department (South Campus) at the Aberdare labs.
       These positions have provided me with the following skills.</p></h4>
<p><h4>
• My lab assistant position allowed me to assist students daily with tasks such as using computer programmes such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, helping them with any kind of technical issue they might encounter with a computer in the lab.
<br>•	This position also allowed me assist students through using CRM, whereby they log cases that we need to resolve via email or phone calls.
<br>•	The position required good interpersonal skills as I had to work with my colleagues and not only assist students but find manners to educate them on the use of the facilities and programmes.
<br>•	This helped me practice the skills I learnt in IT
<br>•	The job required initiative as students require your help to successfully optimize the labs and complete their educational requirements.
<br>•	It placed great importance on teamwork and solving complex technical problems whether it was alone or as a team. There was a need for constant collaboration and communication, it was an environment that I was not only able to adjust to but to actively contribute towards. The technological skills I have gained from this position can be successfully applied to any given work environment.</h4></p>
